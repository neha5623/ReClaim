### Project Description
ReClaim is an innovative web application designed to help individuals locate their lost items on a college campus. By integrating QR codes, Google Forms, and a dynamic website, the platform provides an efficient way to report and claim lost items, promoting accountability and ease of use

### The Problem statement
Losing personal items on a college campus is a common issue, and existing solutions like notice boards, verbal communication, or even asking through social media are inefficient and unreliable. Students and staff struggle to report, track, and claim lost items due to the lack of a centralized and accessible system. Additionally, there is no structured mechanism to validate claims, leading to confusion and delays in returning items. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a tech-enabled platform to streamline the lost-and-found process using web technologies and QR codes.

### The Solution
To address the inefficiencies in locating and claiming lost items on campus, this project proposes a centralized lost-and-found platform. QR codes will be strategically placed around the campus, enabling individuals who find or lose items to access the website easily. Those who find an item can scan the QR code to submit details about the item through a simple Google Form, while those searching for lost items can browse the posted entries on the platform. The platform will display item details, such as images, location found, and contact information, ensuring clarity and easy communication. This tech-enabled solution enhances accessibility, reliability, and speed in the lost-and-found process, eliminating dependency on notice boards or social media.

### Project Demo
# Video
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBF7pw9vlUQs7U6sB8wuqmYesFtk1cmz/view?usp=drive_link]
*This video showcases the complete functionality of our "Lost & Found" platform. It demonstrates how users can easily scan QR codes placed around the college to either report a found item or search for their lost belongings. The video walks through the process of submitting item details via Google Forms, which are then displayed on the platform for others to view. Users can browse a list of lost items, check their details, and claim them with a simple click. The interface is user-friendly, and the flow from scanning the QR code to claiming an item is smooth and intuitive. We also demonstrate how the backend is powered by Google Sheets and the seamless integration of the platform with real-time data updates.*
